# New Organization Structure

The teach pendant files have been reorganized according to feature-based architecture:

## Features

- teach-points
- motion-profiles
- grip-parameters
- sequences

## Shared Resources

- shared/ui (common UI components)
- shared/utils (utility functions)
- hooks (React hooks)
- types (TypeScript type definitions)

## Benefits

1. Feature-oriented organization makes it easier to locate related files
2. Shared components and utilities are centralized
3. Clear separation between features and shared code
4. Type definitions are in a central location
5. Better scalability for future development
